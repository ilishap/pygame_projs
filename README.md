hi so this is in fact my first time doing any game dev and coding in python!

took way longer than it should considering i do have coding experience(just in java tho)

crashed out like seventy times cuz everything kept going wrong...

wrote this in the span of three days (failed a chem test in between which delayed this)

to play: press the dot 10 times to win

if u press anywhere else u lose points

when u reach ten u win
.

there was supposed to be confetti at the end but i messed up sm and got tired
dont hate ik its easy but we all start somewhere right
